# TRADES
TRADES by Michael I Jordan
This is actually somehow a fork from TRADES by Yaodong Yu (https://github.com/yaodongyu/TRADES)

Different from those self-made implementation of PGD or FGSM due to PyTorch coming late, this is an official open-source implementation of https://arxiv.org/pdf/1901.08573.pdf

I will try my best to show my thoughts through this PyTorch project. Let's go with Tony!
